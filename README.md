### Hi there, my name is Zach Blume ðŸ‘‹

I work at at the [Democratic Data Exchange](https://demexchange.com/) (DDX), where I write infrastructure software that helps Democratic political campaigns and progressive organizations share information in realtime.

I co-founded [Raise More](https://join.raisemore.app/), making best-in-class tools for political fundraising.

I am the author of [Autospec, an open-source AI agent](https://github.com/zachblume/autospec) that takes a web app URL and autonomously QAs it, and saves its passing specs as E2E test code.

I co-teach a weekly class called "Introduction to Web Development" to NYC public school students as part of [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/).

I'm a minor open source contributor to React-querybuilder, Supabase, and peerdb.
