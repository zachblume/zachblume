### Hi there, my name is Zach Blume 👋

I work at at the [Democratic Data Exchange](https://demexchange.com/) (DDX), where I write infrastructure tooling that helps Democratic political campaigns and progressive organizations share information in realtime.

I am the co-founder of [Raise More](https://join.raisemore.app/), making best-in-class tools for political fundraising available to everyone.

I also co-teach a weekly class called "Introduction to Web Development" to NYC public school students as part of [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/).

You can also take a look at my open source contributions.
