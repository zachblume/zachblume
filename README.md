### Hi there, my name is Zach Blume ðŸ‘‹

I work at at the [Democratic Data Exchange](https://demexchange.com/) (DDX), where I write infrastructure tooling that helps Democratic political campaigns and progressive organizations share information in realtime.

I am the co-founder of [Raise More](https://www.raisemore.app/), a new platform of best-in-class tools for political fundraising.

You can also take a look at my open source contributions.
