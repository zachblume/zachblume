### Hi there, my name is Zach Blume ðŸ‘‹

For my frontend design & React work, take a look at:
* [RaiseMore](https://github.com/zachblume/raisemore), a donor CRM and phone dialer for political candidates,
* [FieldPlan](https://github.com/zachblume/fieldplan), an analytics and charting application for tracking voter-contact metrics
* [Machine Learning Clinical Trial Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/zachblume/machine-learning-recommendation-engine-demo) (Python and React), a BERT-based machine learning recommendation engine that indexes a table of 15k clinical trial fulltexts and ranks the best fitting trials similar to your query using the same natural language inference, within 120 miliseconds per query. [Try it out here.](https://tmn-demo.vercel.app/)

For my backend work, take a look at:
* [BackRub](https://github.com/zachblume/backrub) (Golang), a search engine rebuilt from scratch according to Google's original infrastructure specifications laid out in Page & Brin's PhD paper.
* [Automate-donor-research](https://github.com/zachblume/automate-donor-research) (SQL), SQL to generate an index for every public political donor in the US.
* [Algorithms-and-data-structures](https://github.com/zachblume/algorithms-and-data-structures) My algorithm problem-solutions in JavaScript and Python.

Other things I'm working on:
* [Daemon](https://github.com/zachblume/daemon) A browser IDE for playground/debugging that renders your JS or Python script to a custom console /on every keystroke/ (Javascript + WASM). Live demo at [www.daemon.live](www.daemon.live)
