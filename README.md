I work at at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

I co-founded [Raise More](https://join.raisemore.app/), best-in-class tools for political fundraising, helping Democrats in 30 states raise over $200m.

I write an [engineering blog](https://www.zachblume.com/).

Open-source:
 - [Autospec, an open-source AI agent](https://github.com/zachblume/autospec) that takes a web app URL and autonomously QAs it, and saves its passing specs as E2E test code (2024)
 - [Declare](https://github.com/zachblume/declare), an exploration of what "framework-defined infrastructure for data engineering" would look like [(related blog post)](https://www.zachblume.com/blog/2024-10-08-framework-defined-infrastructure-for-data-engineering)
 - Some minor open source contributions to other projects, mostly fixing docker self-hosting build bugs e.g. Supabase, peerdb, React-querybuilder, Hatchet.

I co-taught a weekly class called "Introduction to Web Development" to NYC public school students as part of [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/).
