I work at at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

I co-founded [Raise More](https://join.raisemore.app/), making best-in-class tools for political fundraising.

I write an [engineering blog](https://www.zachblume.com/).

Open-source explorations:
 - I am the author of [Autospec, an open-source AI agent](https://github.com/zachblume/autospec) that takes a web app URL and autonomously QAs it, and saves its passing specs as E2E test code. A couple other contributors!
 - I have toyed with a framework-defined infrastructure project for data engineering [Declare](https://github.com/zachblume/declare).

I co-taught a weekly class called "Introduction to Web Development" to NYC public school students as part of [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/).

I've made some minor open source contributions to other projects, mostly fixing bugs with self-hosting configs e.g. React-querybuilder, Supabase, peerdb, Hatchet.
